Hey there! I’m Paweł. I’m a software developer currently writing in PHP.

I live in Poland where I work as a senior software developer in an IT department for a medium-size company. I possess over 7 years of commercial experience. At work, I mostly programme in PHP, however I also split my time between designing, developing, and maintaining infrastructure.

I'm a big fan of craftsmanship and I’m hooked on exploring topics such as DDD or responsible programming.

I'm fascinated with all kinds of technologies related to development, in particular web development.
