After the implementation of this change, it turned out that Javascript suits had sped up from 13 minutes to 8.5 minutes. So, I decided also to run my Javascript suit using Chrome Headless. However, there was one problem, namely my whole environment (development, test on the local machine, and test in CI) is based on on Docker.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://pplotka.dev/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pplotka.dev/about-me/</guid><description>Hey there! I’m Paweł. I’m a software developer currently writing in PHP.
I live in Poland where I work as a senior software developer in an IT department for a medium-size company. I possess over 7 years of commercial experience. At work, I mostly programme in PHP, however I also split my time between designing, developing, and maintaining infrastructure.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of craftsmanship and I’m hooked on exploring topics such as DDD or responsible programming.</description></item></channel></rss>
